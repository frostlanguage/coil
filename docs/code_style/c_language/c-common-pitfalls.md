# Common C Pitfalls

Use this catalogue when reviewing a failure path, designing a regression test, or checking the
assumptions behind a C implementation. It covers memory, arithmetic, concurrency, hardware,
security, and performance failure scenarios.

Find a scenario through the grouped index, inspect its preconditions and examples, then follow the
prevention controls and verification design. The appendices provide complete test programs and a
source record with evidence limits.

Each scenario links to the normative prevention controls in [C Code Standard][c-code-standard] and
[C Module Architecture][c-module-architecture]. It does not add a competing set of implementation
rules. The governance and applicability model is defined [once, in the
standard][c-code-standard-governance].

The [standard's example policy][c-code-standard-example-policy] applies to all embedded examples.
Failure scenarios do not grant exceptions to project requirements.

<a id="evidence-model"></a>

## Evidence model

A CPIT is a generic engineering failure scenario. CWE identifies weakness classes; CAPEC identifies
attack patterns; a CVE identifies a concrete reported vulnerability. CISA KEV records evidence of
known exploitation for particular vulnerabilities. CVSS expresses a scored vulnerability assessment
using its published version/vector. These are different kinds of evidence.

The CWE associations below are reviewed engineering context, not a claim of exact equivalence or an
official MITRE mapping. Broad categories and CWE views must not be treated as concrete root causes.
CPIT-055 is explicitly a project policy risk and has no automatic CWE equivalence. A software
component that does not implement a technology may mark those entries not applicable, with a reason.

The dated CWE Top 25 and OWASP-oriented application topics remain useful coverage prompts; they are
not the complete scope of C memory, arithmetic, or hardware correctness. No generic CPIT, CWE, or
CAPEC entry receives a fabricated CVSS score. A version-3.1 score must not be relabeled version 4.0.

Keep field evidence as a separate dated record containing: component and affected version, CVE,
publisher/advisory URL, root cause, reachability in this product, KEV lookup result and date, actual
CVSS version/vector/source, mitigation owner, fix/retest status, and the relevant CPIT/control IDs.
A CVE cited as an example does not establish that the project is vulnerable. Check the current KEV
status and the published score against the dated field evidence before making a product claim.

## Catalogue use

Find the failure scenario, review its preconditions, follow its prevention controls, and select a
test or analysis appropriate to the real target. Each entry's **Verification design** describes a
regression or review obligation. A completed verification record must identify the test sources,
target configuration, command, and observed result before the check counts as executed evidence.

Each entry includes local failure and prevention examples. Contextual fragments state only the named
scenario; deliberately invalid examples are marked and excluded from executable tests. Complete test
sources remain in the appendix. The [example policy][c-code-standard-example-policy] applies to
every entry.

## Failure scenarios

<a id="cpit-001"></a>

<a id="cpit-001-dangling-pointer"></a>

### CPIT-001: Dangling pointer

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A pointer whose object's lifetime has ended cannot be used as though the object were still alive.
Freeing, leaving a block, resetting an arena, or moving an object can invalidate references.
Retaining the same numeric address does not retain ownership or lifetime. Record the owner and
validity interval, not just the address.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-084][c-code-standard-cstyle-084].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-825][cwe-825], [CWE-416][cwe-416]. See the [official CWE
catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Trace every retained alias across release, block exit, and arena reset;
reject a use after the validity interval.

**Source context:** [asan][c-common-pitfalls-ref-asan]; [ubsan][c-common-pitfalls-ref-ubsan].

**External references:** [CWE-825][cwe-825]; [CWE-416][cwe-416].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

```c
int *EX_badDanglingPointer(void)
{
    int *ret = (int *)(NULL);
    int local_value = 7;

    ret = &local_value;

function_output:
    return ret;
}
```

**Contextual prevention example:**

```c
free(item);
item = (item_t *)(NULL);
```

**Noncompliant fragment (do not copy):**

```c
free(item);
item->state = ITEM_READY;
```

---

<a id="cpit-002"></a>

<a id="cpit-002-use-after-free"></a>

### CPIT-002: Use-after-free

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

An access after release can reach reallocated storage and corrupt a different object. Setting one
owner variable to NULL does not repair other aliases. Ownership, pinning, reference counting,
epochs, hazard pointers, or GC references help only when their complete lifetime protocol applies.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-082][c-code-standard-cstyle-082].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-416][cwe-416]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Delay a consumer across owner release and prove release waits or the
reference remains protected.

**Source context:** [asan][c-common-pitfalls-ref-asan]; [ubsan][c-common-pitfalls-ref-ubsan].

**External references:** [CWE-416][cwe-416].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

```c
int EX_badUseAfterFree(uint8_t buffer[])
{
    int ret = EXIT_SUCCESS;

    free(buffer);
    buffer[0] = 1u;

function_output:
    return ret;
}
```

**Contextual prevention example:**

```c
free(item);
item = (item_t *)(NULL);
```

**Noncompliant fragment (do not copy):**

```c
free(item);
item->state = ITEM_READY;
```

---

<a id="cpit-003"></a>

<a id="cpit-003-double-free"></a>

### CPIT-003: Double free

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Releasing an allocation twice violates the allocator contract. One allocation needs one valid
release authority, or a defined shared-ownership protocol whose last release is unique. Idempotent
destruction of a cleared handle does not make stale copies of that handle safe to destroy.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-082][c-code-standard-cstyle-082].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-415][cwe-415]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Exercise repeated destruction of a cleared handle and reject release
through a stale ownership copy by protocol review.

**Source context:** [asan][c-common-pitfalls-ref-asan]; [ubsan][c-common-pitfalls-ref-ubsan].

**External references:** [CWE-415][cwe-415].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

```c
int EX_badDoubleFree(uint8_t buffer[])
{
    int ret = EXIT_SUCCESS;

    free(buffer);
    free(buffer);

function_output:
    return ret;
}
```

**Contextual prevention example:**

```c
free(item);
item = (item_t *)(NULL);
```

**Noncompliant fragment (do not copy):**

```c
free(item);
free(item);
```

---

<a id="cpit-004"></a>

<a id="cpit-004-memory-leak"></a>

### CPIT-004: Memory leak

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A memory leak occurs when the program loses the path needed to release memory or another finite
resource. In embedded systems this is often a safety issue, not only a performance issue, because
long-running firmware may eventually exhaust a fixed RAM budget. Cleanup paths, arenas, pools, and
long-run leak tests are useful evidence for the applicable product.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-077][c-code-standard-cstyle-077].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-401][cwe-401], [CWE-772][cwe-772]. See the [official CWE
catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Fail each acquisition stage and require all previously acquired resources
to be released.

**External references:** [CWE-401][cwe-401]; [CWE-772][cwe-772].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

```c
int EX_badMemoryLeak(void)
{
    int ret = EXIT_SUCCESS;

    uint8_t *buffer = malloc(128u);

    buffer[0] = 1u;

function_output:
    return ret;
}
```

**Contextual prevention example:**

Layout, diagnostic, or contract example. This block is not executable C.

```text
Establish pointer provenance, lifetime, nullability, ownership, alignment, and
bounds before dereference
```

**Noncompliant fragment (do not copy):**

Layout, diagnostic, or contract example. This block is not executable C.

```text
Dereference/copy/free a pointer whose provenance or lifetime contract is not
established
```

### CPIT-005: Ambiguous ownership

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Ambiguous ownership means the API does not say who owns, borrows, stores, or frees a pointer. This
usually creates either leaks or double frees later. Public APIs must document whether a pointer is
owned, borrowed, static, arena-owned, GC-owned, pinned, or caller-owned.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-082][c-code-standard-cstyle-082].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-664][cwe-664]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Review every public pointer parameter/result against an owner, borrower,
retention, and release statement.

**External references:** [CWE-664][cwe-664].

#### Local examples

<a id="cpit-006-invalid-free"></a>

### CPIT-006: Invalid free

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Invalid free passes something to `free()` that was not returned by the matching allocator family as
a base pointer. Stack addresses, static objects, interior pointers, string literals, and foreign
allocator blocks must never be freed through the wrong API. The fix is to preserve allocator family
and base-pointer identity in the type or API contract.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-086][c-code-standard-cstyle-086].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-590][cwe-590]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Audit release sites to prove a live base from the matching allocator; do
not execute invalid free as a passing test.

**External references:** [CWE-590][cwe-590].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

```c
int EX_badInvalidFree(void)

### CPIT-007: Mismatched allocator

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A mismatched allocator bug allocates with one family and releases with another, such as `malloc()`
with a pool destroy function or a platform allocator with plain `free()`. This breaks allocator
invariants even when the address looks valid. Pair allocation and release functions explicitly in
API names and ownership docs.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-077][c-code-standard-cstyle-077].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-762][cwe-762]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

<a id="cpit-008-stale-pointer-after-realloc"></a>

### CPIT-008: Stale pointer after `realloc`

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Successful `realloc` ends the old allocation's lifetime. Rebuild references from the returned base
even if the numeric address is unchanged. For positive sizes, a failed `realloc` preserves the old
allocation. Zero size is handled before the call by explicit free/reset or rejection; do not use the
ambiguous old pattern of treating every NULL `realloc` result as an ordinary allocation failure. The
buffer example tests preservation and zero-size reset.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-080][c-code-standard-cstyle-080].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-416][cwe-416], [CWE-825][cwe-825]. See the [official CWE

<a id="cpit-009-lost-base-pointer"></a>

### CPIT-009: Lost base pointer

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A lost base pointer happens when code advances or overwrites the only pointer that can be passed
back to the allocator. Interior pointers are useful for parsing, but they must not replace the
owning base pointer. Keep base and cursor fields separate.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-082][c-code-standard-cstyle-082].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-401][cwe-401], [CWE-761][cwe-761]. See the [official CWE

<a id="cpit-010-interior-pointer-escape"></a>

### CPIT-010: Interior pointer escape

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

An interior pointer escape stores a pointer to a field, element, or middle of an object beyond the
parent object's lifetime or ownership boundary. This hides the real allocation and makes lifetime
review difficult. Use handles, indexes, or an explicit parent-object reference when the subobject
must escape.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-096][c-code-standard-cstyle-096].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-825][cwe-825], [CWE-664][cwe-664]. See the [official CWE

**Verification design:** Retain a subobject reference across parent invalidation in a model and
reject the lifetime transition.

### CPIT-011: NULL pointer dereference

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Dereferencing `NULL` is undefined behavior in C. It commonly follows unchecked allocation, optional
arguments, failed lookups, or partial initialization. Validate nullable inputs at the boundary and
reserve assertions for internal invariants that cannot be violated by external input.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-058][c-code-standard-cstyle-058].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-476][cwe-476]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Pass contractually nullable or invalid NULL inputs and require the
documented status before access.

**External references:** [CWE-476][cwe-476].

### CPIT-012: Uninitialized pointer

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

An uninitialized pointer contains an indeterminate value, not a safe default. Reading or
dereferencing it can jump into arbitrary memory or trigger undefined behavior before any obvious
branch. Initialize all pointers at function entry using typed `NULL` under CSTYLE-107, then assign
validated live objects before use. Aggregate initialization follows the same control.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-107][c-code-standard-cstyle-107].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-824][cwe-824], [CWE-457][cwe-457]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-013: Out-of-bounds write

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

An out-of-bounds write stores data outside the target object. In allocators and embedded runtimes
this may overwrite metadata, control blocks, adjacent objects, return addresses, or hardware
descriptors. Every write must be guarded by a validated base pointer, capacity, offset, and write
size.

### CPIT-015: Buffer underflow

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Buffer underflow accesses memory before the start of an object, usually through a decremented
pointer, negative index, or unsigned wraparound. It is the same class of boundary violation as
overflow but often missed in reviews because the code visually moves "backward." Check lower bounds
explicitly.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-099][c-code-standard-cstyle-099].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-124][cwe-124]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Review decrements at index zero and signed negative indices; require the

### CPIT-017: One-past-end dereference

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

C allows forming a pointer one past the end of an array object, but not dereferencing it. That

Pointer arithmetic is only defined within the same array object and its one-past position.
Arithmetic derived from external offsets, serialized metadata, or integer addresses must be

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Equality of valid pointer values is distinct from relational ordering. Relational comparison of
unrelated object pointers is not a portable heap-range or ownership check. Use recorded offsets and
allocation metadata under a defined address-domain contract. Stale or indeterminate pointers are not

### CPIT-021: Pointer provenance violation

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A numeric address alone does not establish that a pointer designates a live object with valid
provenance and access rights. Low-level allocators and hardware adapters must document their
target/compiler assumptions. Portable application code must not recreate pointers from serialized or
untrusted integer values. Not every implementation-supported round trip is inherently erroneous.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-098][c-code-standard-cstyle-098].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-758][cwe-758]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Review every pointer/integer reconstruction against a target-qualified
representation and lifetime contract.

### CPIT-022: Strict aliasing violation

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Access through an incompatible effective type can violate the optimizer's language assumptions.
Character types may inspect object representation; unsigned char is the preferred byte-value view. A
`memcpy` representation copy still needs valid storage, sufficient length, and an allowed
destination representation. It is not an endian conversion or an arbitrary object constructor.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-098][c-code-standard-cstyle-098].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-843][cwe-843], [CWE-758][cwe-758]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-023: Invalid `restrict` aliasing

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A violated restrict contract can make an otherwise plausible access invalid. The rule concerns
access paths and modifications over the relevant execution; it is not a blanket ban on every pair of
read-only aliases. Use restrict only when its actual requirements are proved and callers can satisfy
them. Document permitted overlap separately from the qualifier.

### CPIT-024: Invalid alignment

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Typed object access requires suitable alignment. A byte buffer with enough bytes does not
necessarily provide valid storage for an arbitrary struct. Establish alignment and
object/effective-type validity before conversion and use. Prefer fieldwise decoding or an allocator
with the required alignment contract.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-096][c-code-standard-cstyle-096].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-758][cwe-758], [CWE-119][cwe-119]. See the [official CWE

**Verification design:** Use deliberately unaligned byte input only with bytewise decoders; typed
accesses need proved alignment.

**Source context:** [c23][c-common-pitfalls-ref-c23].

### CPIT-025: Pointer truncation

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Pointer truncation stores an address in an integer type that cannot represent all pointer values, or
later casts it back. This breaks on wider address spaces, segmented systems, and capability-like
targets. Use `uintptr_t` only in low-level adapter code and document why the conversion is valid.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-097][c-code-standard-cstyle-097].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-681][cwe-681], [CWE-704][cwe-704]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-026: Function pointer type mismatch

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Calling a function through an incompatible function pointer type is undefined behavior. The ABI may
pass arguments or return values differently even when the sizes look similar. Callback typedefs must
exactly match the called function signature.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-071][c-code-standard-cstyle-071].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-758][cwe-758], [CWE-843][cwe-843]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-027: Object pointer/function pointer mixing

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

C does not guarantee object pointers and function pointers have the same representation or
conversion rules. Storing function pointers in `void *` or object pointers in callback slots is not
portable. Keep object and function pointer paths typed and separate.

### CPIT-028: Union pointer confusion

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A union that can hold multiple pointer or scalar interpretations needs an explicit active-member
tag. Reading an inactive member or scanning the wrong union arm can corrupt GC tracing,
serialization, or ownership decisions. Prefer tagged unions with checked state transitions.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-038][c-code-standard-cstyle-038].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-843][cwe-843], [CWE-758][cwe-758]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-029: Array-to-pointer decay

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Array parameters decay to pointers, losing size information. `sizeof(param)` then returns pointer
size, not array size. Every API receiving an array must also receive element count, byte size, or a
pointer to an explicitly sized array type.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-063][c-code-standard-cstyle-063].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-467][cwe-467], [CWE-131][cwe-131]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-030: Hidden or encoded pointer

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Encoding an address into an integer can hide a reference from ownership analysis, GC root scanning,
or a relocation mechanism. Encoding is not inherently a C vulnerability, but treating the result as
an ordinary recoverable pointer without a proved representation/lifetime protocol is unsafe. Confine
legitimate tagging to a qualified low-level adapter or use non-address handles.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-069][c-code-standard-cstyle-069].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-758][cwe-758], [CWE-664][cwe-664]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-031: Pointer to moved object

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Relocation invalidates raw references that the moving runtime has not updated. A pointer return
alone is not evidence of this defect; the failing sequence is retain an address, move the object,
then reuse that old reference. Use the runtime's registered roots, handles, or a valid pin/unpin
protocol.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-082][c-code-standard-cstyle-082].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-416][cwe-416], [CWE-825][cwe-825]. See the [official CWE

**Verification design:** Model relocation between reference creation and use; require handles,

### CPIT-032: Borrowed pointer stored beyond lifetime

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A borrowed pointer is valid only for the documented call, scope, or transaction. Storing it in a
long-lived object silently turns a borrow into ownership without the release authority. Copy the
data, retain the owner, or change the API to transfer ownership.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-071][c-code-standard-cstyle-071].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-825][cwe-825], [CWE-664][cwe-664]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-033: Heap object points to stack memory

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A longer-lived object may store a pointer to automatic storage and later use it after the storage's
lifetime ends. Heap allocation does not necessarily outlive every stack object; a borrow is valid
when all uses finish first. Document that interval or copy/retain separately owned data before
returning.

**Verification design:** Trace a retained automatic object through its block exit; prove all
borrowing users stop first.

**External references:** [CWE-825][cwe-825]; [CWE-562][cwe-562].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

`local_bytes` is an automatic array; `copy_owned` copies it during the call. A heap object pointing

### CPIT-128: Flexible-array capacity mismatch

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-130`][c-code-standard-cstyle-130]

**Flexible-array capacity mismatch.** A flexible array member has no payload storage in
`sizeof(struct_type)`. If allocation size, recorded capacity, and copy length do not describe the
same allocation, an apparently valid index can write beyond the object. Keep the total allocation
size and payload capacity in one checked ownership contract.

### CPIT-132: Pointer size mistaken for object capacity

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-136`][c-code-standard-cstyle-136]

**Pointer size mistaken for object capacity.** `sizeof(pointer)` reports the pointer representation
size, not the size of its allocation. Using that value as a copy, clear, comparison, or I/O bound
often processes only four or eight bytes and can leave stale data or weaken validation.

**External references:** [CWE-467][cwe-467].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-137`][c-code-standard-cstyle-137]

**Representation zeroing mistaken for semantic initialization.** `memset()` writes bytes; it does
not assign the C zero value to each member. An arbitrary typed object may contain pointers,
floating-point values, enums, padding, or a domain default whose representation is not
all-bits-zero. Use C initialization syntax or a type-specific reset function.

### CPIT-154: Pool-allocated object escapes its scope

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CMOD-098`][c-module-architecture-cmod-098]

**Pool-allocated object escapes its scope.** A pointer allocated for one packet, request, frame,
file, phase, or arena is retained by state that survives bulk reclamation. The allocator releases
every object correctly, but the retained pointer becomes dangling. Name allocator scopes in API
contracts, prohibit cross-scope storage, and register cleanup for non-memory resources.

**External references:** [CWE-825][cwe-825].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

The destination callback copies before the arena/pool reset; it does not retain `borrowed_bytes`. A
handle alternative must invalidate on reset.

```c
saved_pointer = arena_object;
arena_reset(arena_context);

### CPIT-036: Indeterminate value read

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Automatic objects that are not initialized can contain indeterminate values. Reading them can be
undefined behavior, especially for pointer or trap-capable representations. Initialize every object
before first read and avoid using padding bytes as meaningful data.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-107][c-code-standard-cstyle-107].

### CPIT-037: Trap representation

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Some object types and target representations cannot be populated safely by arbitrary bits. A byte
copy or memset does not necessarily construct a valid pointer, floating value, synchronization
object, or platform handle. Validate representations under the chosen C edition and target rather
than assuming every type has the same zero-bit semantics.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-100][c-code-standard-cstyle-100].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-758][cwe-758]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Reject arbitrary-byte construction of pointer/synchronization objects;

### CPIT-038: Signed integer overflow

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Signed overflow is undefined behavior in C, not two's-complement wrap in portable code. Optimizers
may remove checks if they assume overflow cannot happen. Use checked arithmetic helpers before
computing sizes, indexes, offsets, counters, or protocol fields.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-101][c-code-standard-cstyle-101].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-190][cwe-190], [CWE-758][cwe-758]. See the [official CWE

**Verification design:** Test exact signed limits and rejected overflows using a checked operation,
not an overflowing test expression.

**External references:** [CWE-190][cwe-190]; [CWE-758][cwe-758].

#### Local examples

### CPIT-039: Invalid shift

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Shifting by a negative count or by a count greater than or equal to the promoted type width is
undefined behavior. Left shifting into an invalid signed value is also dangerous. Validate shift
counts and prefer unsigned operands with explicit masks.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-101][c-code-standard-cstyle-101].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-682][cwe-682], [CWE-758][cwe-758]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-040: Divide overflow

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

The mathematical quotient of the minimum signed value and negative one may not be representable.
Reject that case for both division and remainder before evaluation. This is separate from the
zero-divisor case; checking only the divisor against zero is insufficient.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-103][c-code-standard-cstyle-103].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-190][cwe-190], [CWE-369][cwe-369]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-041: Invalid effective type access

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

C tracks the effective type of an object for aliasing and optimization. Reading storage through an
unrelated typed lvalue can break compiler assumptions. Use `memcpy()` for type re-interpretation and
keep serialized representations as bytes until decoded.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-100][c-code-standard-cstyle-100].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-843][cwe-843], [CWE-758][cwe-758]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-042: VLA with invalid bound

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Variable-length arrays depend on runtime sizes. Zero, negative, huge, or tainted bounds can trigger
undefined behavior or stack exhaustion. Project code prohibits VLAs under `CSTYLE-108`; use checked
fixed buffers, explicit heap policy, or caller-provided storage.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-108][c-code-standard-cstyle-108].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-129][cwe-129], [CWE-789][cwe-789]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-043: `longjmp` into dead frame

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

`longjmp()` is only valid while the target `setjmp()` frame still exists. Jumping into a returned
frame corrupts control flow and stack lifetime. Avoid non-local jumps in project code unless a
narrow adapter owns the full lifetime protocol.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-053][c-code-standard-cstyle-053].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-758][cwe-758], [CWE-562][cwe-562]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-044: Modified non-volatile local after `setjmp`

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

After `longjmp()`, local non-`volatile` variables modified after `setjmp()` have indeterminate
values. This surprises error-recovery code. Avoid relying on local state across
`setjmp()`/`longjmp()` or keep the state in an explicitly managed object.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-100][c-code-standard-cstyle-100].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-758][cwe-758]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Review automatic locals changed after setjmp and read after longjmp under

state changes, then return `ret` once at `function_output`.

### CPIT-134: Function arguments depend on evaluation order

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-116`][c-code-standard-cstyle-116]

**Function arguments depend on evaluation order.** C does not require ordinary function arguments to
run left-to-right. If two calls communicate through shared state, the result can change by compiler,
optimization level, or target. Evaluate each operation in a separate statement and pass stable
values.

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-129`][c-code-standard-cstyle-129]

**Inactive union member read.** Writing one representation and reading another uses the union as an
implicit reinterpretation mechanism or violates a tagged alternative's active-member contract. Use
the explicit discriminator for semantic alternatives and `memcpy()` for representation bytes.

**External references:** [CWE-843][cwe-843].

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-152`][c-code-standard-cstyle-152]

**Semantic object copied as bytes.** Whole-object assignment or `memcpy()` can duplicate owned
pointers, locks, reference counts, descriptors, callbacks, or intrusive links without duplicating
their resource and identity contracts. Use a named copy, clone, retain, move, or duplicate
operation.

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-155`][c-code-standard-cstyle-155]

**Discarded `const` qualification.** A cast can suppress a diagnostic but cannot make a genuinely

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-147`][c-code-standard-cstyle-147]

**Invalid callback invocation.** An optional, stale, corrupted, or incompletely bound function
pointer can become an indirect call through an invalid address. Validate mandatory callbacks at
binding and nullable callbacks at the call boundary. [CVE-2025-11618][cve-2025-11618] provides

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-150`][c-code-standard-cstyle-150]

**Unproved compiler assumption.** An unreachable or assume primitive tells the optimizer that a path

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-158`][c-code-standard-cstyle-158]

**Sequence pointer without extent.** Array parameter notation adjusts to a pointer and does not

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CMOD-090`][c-module-architecture-cmod-090]

**Partial mutation before validation.** An operation that changes visible state before checking a

### CPIT-146: Inline assembly has an incomplete machine contract

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-162`][c-code-standard-cstyle-162]

**Inline assembly has an incomplete machine contract.** The instructions appear correct in

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-167`][c-code-standard-cstyle-167]

**Unaligned external data is accessed as a typed object.** A byte offset is cast to a wider pointer

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-171`][c-code-standard-cstyle-171]

A parser receives bytes described only as text. Locale, platform code page, malformed UTF sequences,

### CPIT-050: Alignment rounding overflow

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Alignment helpers usually add `align - 1` before masking. That addition can overflow, and invalid
alignments such as zero or non-powers of two can corrupt the result. Validate alignment and use
checked addition before rounding.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-102][c-code-standard-cstyle-102].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-190][cwe-190], [CWE-682][cwe-682]. See the [official CWE
catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Test alignment rounding near SIZE_MAX and require power-of-two validation
if that algorithm assumes it.

**External references:** [CWE-190][cwe-190]; [CWE-682][cwe-682].

#### Local examples

### CPIT-051: Division by zero

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Division and modulo require a non-zero divisor. Divisors derived from input, configuration, hardware
counters, or decoded metadata must be treated as untrusted. Validate before both `/` and `%`.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-103][c-code-standard-cstyle-103].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-369][cwe-369]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Reject zero before both division and modulo, including externally computed

### CPIT-052: Narrowing conversion

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Narrowing converts a value into a type that may not represent it. This can silently truncate
lengths, file offsets, enum values, or hardware register fields. Check lower and upper bounds before
the cast.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-097][c-code-standard-cstyle-097].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-681][cwe-681], [CWE-197][cwe-197]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-053: Signed/unsigned mixing

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Mixing signed and unsigned values can convert a negative value into a very large unsigned value.
This affects comparisons, loop termination, and bounds checks. Normalize values to a single checked
domain before comparing or doing arithmetic.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-097][c-code-standard-cstyle-097].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-195][cwe-195], [CWE-681][cwe-681]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-054: Enum conversion out of range

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Casting an integer to an enum does not prove the value is one of the defined enumerators. It can
index jump tables, state tables, or policy arrays out of range. Check the raw integer against the
enum range before casting.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-060][c-code-standard-cstyle-060].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-704][cwe-704], [CWE-129][cwe-129]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-055: Floating-point in core allocator

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Floating point for allocator addresses or sizes conflicts with this project's exact-integer
invariant policy. Floating point is not by itself a vulnerability or undefined behavior, so this
entry has no automatic CWE equivalence. Review precision, range, rounding, runtime dependencies, and
reproducibility if a non-core analysis tool uses it.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-106][c-code-standard-cstyle-106],
[CSTYLE-086][c-code-standard-cstyle-086], [CSTYLE-058][c-code-standard-cstyle-058],

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-128`][c-code-standard-cstyle-128]

**Plain `char` used as binary numeric storage.** An implementation decides whether plain `char` is
signed. A byte above the positive signed range can therefore become negative and change promotion,
comparison, indexing, or shift behavior across targets. Use a type with an explicit signed or
unsigned interpretation and domain.

### CPIT-056: `memcpy` with overlap

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

`memcpy()` requires non-overlapping ranges. If the source and destination overlap, behavior is
undefined and may depend on copy direction or optimization. Use `memmove()` when overlap is
possible.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-086][c-code-standard-cstyle-086].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-475][cwe-475], [CWE-758][cwe-758]. See the [official CWE
catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Establish non-overlapping ranges for `memcpy` or use a defined overlapping
move with validated bounds.

**External references:** [CWE-475][cwe-475]; [CWE-758][cwe-758].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

### CPIT-057: `memcpy`/`memset` invalid pointer

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A byte-library call still requires the pointers, ranges, and lifetime required by its contract. A
zero length must not be used as a universal excuse to pass an invalid pointer. The project handles
supported empty/NULL operations before calling libc and never forms a pointer beyond its valid
object range.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-058][c-code-standard-cstyle-058].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-476][cwe-476], [CWE-787][cwe-787]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-058: `strlen` on unterminated data

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

`strlen()` searches until a NUL byte, so it is unsafe for fixed-size data that may not be
terminated. It can scan past the object and disclose or fault on adjacent memory. Track string
length explicitly or use bounded scanning wrappers.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-087][c-code-standard-cstyle-087].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-126][cwe-126], [CWE-125][cwe-125]. See the [official CWE

**Verification design:** Feed nonterminated bounded data and require tracked-length handling rather
than unbounded scanning.

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

These functions do not know the destination capacity. They are almost always wrong at trust
boundaries and in embedded code. Use checked formatting or bounded copy wrappers that report
truncation.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-086][c-code-standard-cstyle-086].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-120][cwe-120], [CWE-787][cwe-787]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-060: `strncpy` missing NUL

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

`strncpy()` is often mistaken for a safe string copy, but it may leave the destination unterminated.
It also pads with zeros in ways that can be inefficient or misleading. Prefer explicit bounded
string helpers with termination guarantees.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-087][c-code-standard-cstyle-087].

A format string is executable parsing metadata, not plain text. If external input controls it, `%n`,
width fields, or type mismatches can corrupt memory or leak data. Always pass external strings
through `"%s"` or a literal format.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-068][c-code-standard-cstyle-068].

### CPIT-067: `system` with external input

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Shell execution turns data into commands. Quoting mistakes become command injection, especially with

### CPIT-068: Ignored return value

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Many C library calls signal failure only through a return value or `errno`. Ignoring it turns
recoverable errors into silent data loss, partial writes, lock failures, or invalid state. Check
every meaningful return value and document intentional ignores.

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-135`][c-code-standard-cstyle-135]

**Stale or overwritten `errno`.** A successful library call need not clear `errno`, and a later call

### CPIT-147: Partial I/O is treated as complete

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-163`][c-code-standard-cstyle-163]

**Partial I/O is treated as complete.** A positive result is accepted as proof that the requested

**External references:** [CWE-252][cwe-252].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

Entry-declared counters and ret; caller provides `requested_bytes` writable storage. The injected

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-163`][c-code-standard-cstyle-163]

**Interrupted I/O loses progress or retry policy.** Code retries blindly after `EINTR`, duplicates

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-165`][c-code-standard-cstyle-165]

**Counted data is treated as a NUL-terminated string.** A parser or protocol provides a pointer and

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-172`][c-code-standard-cstyle-172]

A process creates a descriptor or handle as inheritable, then tries to clear the inheritance flag in
a later operation. Another thread can spawn or fork+exec in the gap and leak the resource into the

### CPIT-069: Data race

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A data race happens when concurrent contexts access shared state without a valid synchronization
relationship and at least one access writes. The result is undefined or target-dependent behavior,
not merely "last writer wins." Protect shared objects with mutexes, atomics, critical sections, or
single-owner message passing.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-092][c-code-standard-cstyle-092].

### CPIT-070: Improper locking

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Improper locking includes missing locks, locking the wrong object, unlocking from the wrong owner,
or protecting only some accesses. It creates code that appears synchronized while still racing.
Document the protected object set for every lock.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-092][c-code-standard-cstyle-092].

### CPIT-071: Deadlock

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Deadlock occurs when tasks wait forever for resources held by each other. Nested locks, callbacks
under lock, and inconsistent lock ordering are common causes. Define lock order, avoid external
calls while locked, and test shutdown/error paths.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-092][c-code-standard-cstyle-092].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-833][cwe-833]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Check lock acquisition graph for cycles and include callback/reentrant

### CPIT-072: Spurious wakeup bug

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Condition-variable waits can wake without the condition being true. Code that uses `if` instead of
`while` may consume missing data or continue in an invalid state. Always re-check the predicate in a
loop while the mutex is held.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-092][c-code-standard-cstyle-092].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-667][cwe-667]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Wake a waiting thread without satisfying its predicate; it must keep

### CPIT-073: Destroying locked mutex

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Destroying a mutex, condition variable, or other synchronization object while another context can
still access it breaks the lifecycle contract. Shutdown must first stop users, join threads, drain
callbacks, and then destroy synchronization objects.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-091][c-code-standard-cstyle-091].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-667][cwe-667], [CWE-664][cwe-664]. See the [official CWE

<a id="cpit-074-incorrect-atomic-memory-order"></a>

### CPIT-074: Incorrect atomic memory order

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Atomic accesses to the atomic object do not make dependent non-atomic data safe automatically. A
relaxed readiness flag alone does not publish a payload. A valid release/acquire relationship, or
another proved protocol, must connect the initialization and subsequent reads. Publication and safe
reclamation are separate obligations.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-092][c-code-standard-cstyle-092].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-362][cwe-362]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Show the release/acquire observation relation for a payload and test its
publication lifecycle.

**External references:** [CWE-362][cwe-362].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

A consumer uses acquire on ready before reading value; the initialized object remains alive and is
not concurrently reused. This is a publication fragment, not a complete queue.

```c
payload->value = value;
atomic_store_explicit(&payload->ready, true, memory_order_relaxed);
```

**Contextual prevention example:**

A consumer uses acquire on ready before reading value; the initialized object remains alive and is
not concurrently reused. This is a publication fragment, not a complete queue.

### CPIT-075: Volatile used as synchronization

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

`volatile` prevents some compiler access optimizations, but it does not provide atomicity, mutual
exclusion, or inter-thread ordering. It is appropriate for hardware-facing state, not as a threading
primitive. Use atomics or locks for concurrency.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-089][c-code-standard-cstyle-089].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-362][cwe-362]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Reject volatile-only thread synchronization and identify the actual lock or

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Interrupt handlers can preempt normal code in the middle of multi-step updates. `volatile` alone
does not make read-modify-write sequences safe. Use atomic operations, interrupt masking, lock-free
protocols, or hardware-specific critical sections.

miss the change. The error needs a schedule and an invariant; returning a pointer by itself does not
demonstrate ABA. Tagged versions need an overflow policy. Hazard pointers/epochs address reclamation
under their protocols but do not eliminate all logical ABA in reused, still-live nodes.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-092][c-code-standard-cstyle-092].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-362][cwe-362], [CWE-416][cwe-416]. See the [official CWE
catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Write an A-B-A schedule and show version/lifetime protection preserves the
algorithm's invariant.

**External references:** [CWE-362][cwe-362]; [CWE-416][cwe-416].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

A protocol-owned handle carries an identity/version and valid retention. The owner proves wrap/reuse
and reclamation safety. Neither an unchanged address nor a hazard pointer alone solves every logical
ABA case.

```c
observed = head;
/* Other threads remove A, reuse its address, and publish it again. */
if (head == observed)
{
    assume_same_logical_object(head);
}
```

**Contextual prevention example:**

A protocol-owned handle carries an identity/version and valid retention. The owner proves wrap/reuse

if (ret != EXIT_SUCCESS)

### CPIT-079: Reentrancy violation

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Reentrancy bugs happen when an API can be called again before the first call finishes and both calls
mutate hidden shared state. Allocator hooks, logging callbacks, signal paths, and user callbacks can
all re-enter allocator code. Document reentrancy, avoid hidden mutable state, and do not call
external callbacks while internal allocator locks or partial state updates are active.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-092][c-code-standard-cstyle-092].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-663][cwe-663], [CWE-362][cwe-362]. See the [official CWE
catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Exercise documented synchronous reentry rejection and require no
destruction of the active instance.

**External references:** [CWE-663][cwe-663]; [CWE-362][cwe-362].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

### CPIT-080: Thread-local storage leak

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Thread-local caches and arenas are useful for allocator speed, but they create lifecycle
obligations. If a thread exits without deregistering and flushing TLS state, memory can leak or
stale metadata can remain reachable during shutdown. Register TLS at thread entry and clean it
before exit.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-091][c-code-standard-cstyle-091].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-401][cwe-401], [CWE-664][cwe-664]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-081: Refcount overflow

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Reference counters are ownership controls, so arithmetic overflow is a memory-safety bug. If a
refcount wraps to zero or a small value, an object can be freed while live references still exist.
Check increments before use and reject, saturate, or fail cleanly before the counter wraps.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-102][c-code-standard-cstyle-102].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-190][cwe-190], [CWE-416][cwe-416]. See the [official CWE

**Verification design:** Prove refcount increment bounds and unique final release; reject wraparound
before it occurs.

**External references:** [CWE-190][cwe-190]; [CWE-416][cwe-416].

#### Local examples

### CPIT-082: Concurrent double free

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A double free can be caused by a race even when each individual code path appears to free only once.
Two contexts can observe the object as live, then both release it. Free paths must perform an atomic
state transition or hold the object-owner lock before releasing memory.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-092][c-code-standard-cstyle-092].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-415][cwe-415], [CWE-362][cwe-362]. See the [official CWE

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-168`][c-code-standard-cstyle-168]

**Wall-clock changes corrupt duration or deadline logic.** The wall clock is adjusted by
synchronization, administration, leap handling, or a platform event while code uses it to measure
elapsed time. A retry can expire early, wait too long, or never finish. Use one monotonic domain and
its checked comparison helpers for durations and relative deadlines.

**External references:** [CWE-682][cwe-682].

#### Local examples

**Failure fragment (do not execute):**

Both timestamps come from the same monotonic epoch and unit, with a no-wrap interval contract.
Variables are entry declarations. Wall-clock timestamps are a different type/domain in the

### CPIT-091: Missing stale-data detection

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Sensor and network values can expire while remaining numerically plausible. Control logic must know
whether data is fresh. Use timestamps, sequence counters, validity flags, and timeout-to-safe-state
rules.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-059][c-code-standard-cstyle-059].

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-127`][c-code-standard-cstyle-127]

**Bit-field layout used as an external representation.** C does not provide a portable bit
allocation order or storage-unit layout for bit-fields. Mapping them onto MMIO, packets, files,
persistent state, or ABI can assign a named field to different physical bits after a compiler,
target, or option change. Use fixed-width values with named masks and explicit encoding.

### CPIT-169: Power loss exposes a partially committed persistent update

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-173`][c-code-standard-cstyle-173]

A persistent update overwrites several fields in place. Power loss or reset between writes leaves a
mixture of old and new state that passes no transaction boundary.

Use a journal, A/B slot, write-ahead log, copy-on-write update, or another protocol with a tested
commit point and recovery rule.

### CPIT-094: Tainted size trusted

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Sizes, counts, offsets, indexes, enum values, and state-machine inputs from outside the trust
boundary must be treated as hostile or corrupt. Validate them before allocation, indexing,
arithmetic, casting, or state transitions.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-059][c-code-standard-cstyle-059].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-20][cwe-20], [CWE-129][cwe-129]. See the [official CWE

### CPIT-095: Format string injection

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

A format string controls how variadic arguments are interpreted. External input used as a format can
read memory, write through `%n`, or crash through type mismatches. Logging and formatting wrappers
should require literal formats where possible.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-068][c-code-standard-cstyle-068].

### CPIT-096: Hardcoded secret

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Secrets embedded in source or firmware are difficult to rotate and easy to extract from binaries.
Device credentials, keys, passwords, and provisioning tokens must come from a secure provisioning or
storage mechanism, not from constants in code.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-086][c-code-standard-cstyle-086].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-798][cwe-798]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Inspect source/build outputs for embedded production secrets and test

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Logs often leave the device, persist longer than memory, and reach broader audiences than runtime
state. Never log credentials, private keys, session tokens, personal data, or raw sensitive
payloads. Redact at the logging boundary.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-067][c-code-standard-cstyle-067].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-532][cwe-532]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Verify denied operations and exceptions do not place credentials or raw

### CPIT-098: Missing secure erase

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Sensitive bytes may remain after their logical use ends. Use a qualified secure-erasure primitive
when the threat model requires it, and verify the compiler/runtime behavior. An ordinary memset or a
generic compiler barrier is not automatically sufficient. C23 `memset_explicit` is an option when
available. Erasing one buffer does not erase its copies, logs, dumps, registers, or media.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-086][c-code-standard-cstyle-086].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-226][cwe-226]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Review the qualified erase primitive and copies; do not infer erasure from
an optimized-away source statement.

Custom cryptography usually fails in subtle ways: mode misuse, nonce reuse, side channels, weak
randomness, or unauthenticated encryption. Use reviewed libraries and platform-approved primitives
behind a small adapter.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-029][c-code-standard-cstyle-029].

Predictable random values break keys, tokens, nonces, challenges, and protocol freshness. `rand()`
and simple PRNGs are not security sources. Use a cryptographic RNG and handle entropy-source failure
explicitly.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-086][c-code-standard-cstyle-086].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-338][cwe-338]. See the [official CWE catalogue][ref-cwe].

### CPIT-101: Missing firmware signature check

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Executable updates need authenticity rooted in trusted keys or another approved trust mechanism.
Validate target identity, metadata, integrity, and activation policy before execution. A matching
hash from an untrusted source does not authenticate the image. Power-fail-safe activation and

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

If external data reaches a shell command, separators, substitution, quoting, and environment
behavior become attack surface. Runtime C code should avoid shell execution and use explicit APIs
with fixed argument vectors when process launch is unavoidable.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-109][c-code-standard-cstyle-109].

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

Untrusted paths can escape a permitted root through traversal, links, platform aliases, or check/use
races. Canonicalizing a pathname once is not enough when another actor can replace a component

### CPIT-122: XML external entity or recursive entity expansion

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

When XML is accepted from an untrusted boundary, a parser that resolves external entities or permits
unbounded recursive expansion can access local/network resources or consume unbounded memory/CPU.
Disable those features unless the protocol explicitly requires and safely constrains them.

**Prevention controls:** [CSTYLE-111][c-code-standard-cstyle-111].

**Weakness context:** [CWE-611][cwe-611], [CWE-776][cwe-776]. See the [official CWE
catalogue][ref-cwe].

**Verification design:** Supply external and recursive entities; reject resolution/expansion beyond
the explicitly allowed parser policy.

**Source context:** [xxe][c-common-pitfalls-ref-xxe].

**External references:** [CWE-611][cwe-611]; [CWE-776][cwe-776]; [CAPEC-201][capec-201]; [OWASP

### CPIT-155: A supported configuration is never built

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CMOD-100`][c-module-architecture-cmod-100]

**A supported configuration is never built.** Conditional code compiles only for a non-default
compiler, byte order, width, optional feature, allocator, or hardening mode, but CI exercises only
the default. Inventory supported products and make every distinctive conditional branch owned by the
build-and-test matrix.

### CPIT-156: A failure path exists but cannot be injected

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CMOD-101`][c-module-architecture-cmod-101]

**A failure path exists but cannot be injected.** Allocation, I/O, hardware, or dependency code
reports errors in theory, but no deterministic test can reach the cleanup and recovery branch. Put
injection at the owned adapter and verify status, invariant preservation, cleanup, retry bounds, and
observable effects.

**External references:** [CWE-755][cwe-755].

#### Local examples

**Contextual prevention example:**

Test-only allocator context. The failpoint index is illustrative; declare/zero `fault_state` at
entry and set this field after validation. Verify ownership and cleanup in addition to the expected
error.

```c
fault_state.fail_on_allocation = 2u;
ret                            = invoke_operation(operation_context);

### CPIT-157: Generated source drift hides the reviewed input

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CMOD-103`][c-module-architecture-cmod-103]

**Generated source drift hides the reviewed input.** A committed C file is edited manually or
produced with an unknown tool version, so reviewers cannot reconstruct it from authoritative inputs.
Pin or declare the generator policy, regenerate in CI, compare output, and test the emitted
translation unit.

**External references:** [CWE-494][cwe-494]; [CAPEC-184][capec-184]; [OWASP prevention
guidance][owasp-ci-cd-security].

#### Local examples

**Contextual prevention example:**

Build manifest fields. Regeneration checks compare real digests; editing generated C without
updating its generating input violates this contract.

```c
typedef struct GeneratedSourceRecord

### CPIT-158: Imported source loses upstream lineage

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CMOD-104`][c-module-architecture-cmod-104]

**Imported source loses upstream lineage.** A local copy no longer records its origin revision,
patch series, or update owner. Security advisories and upstream fixes cannot be matched reliably.
Record immutable provenance and keep local functional patches reviewable and replayable.

**External references:** [CWE-1104][cwe-1104]; [CAPEC-439][capec-439]; [OWASP prevention

### CPIT-170: Stable API disappears without a migration window

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CMOD-107`][c-module-architecture-cmod-107]

A stable API vanishes or changes contract without a deprecation state, replacement, release note, or
compatibility decision. Consumers discover the break only after upgrading.

Use the project API lifecycle registry and keep stable APIs through the approved migration window.

**External references:** [NIST secure development practices][nist-sp-800-218-ssdf-v11].

#### Local examples

**Contextual prevention example:**

Public-header transition example, with versioned contracts and a documented overlap/removal window.
The old function must remain implemented while promised; declarations alone do not provide ABI

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CMOD-108`][c-module-architecture-cmod-108]

One target bypasses the project hardening profile and ships without a mitigation that the platform

### CPIT-192: Specialized artifact executes after its invariant changed

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CPERF-008`][c-code-standard-cperf-008]

Cached code, a function binding, or another specialized artifact remains active after the state used

**External references:** [CWE-758][cwe-758].

#### Local examples

**Contextual prevention example:**

Externally synchronized owner fragment. Generation changes cover every assumed invariant; wrap/reuse
is prohibited while an older artifact may exist. invalidate, bind and execute are validated owner
callbacks. Rebinding must not publish a partial artifact.

```c

### CPIT-193: Mixed declarator type confusion

**Class:** FAILURE_SCENARIO. Apply the scope and requirement words below.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-138`][c-code-standard-cstyle-138]

**CWE:** [CWE-704][cwe-704], [CWE-843][cwe-843]

A declaration such as `int *a, b;` gives `a` and `b` different indirection even though the visual
prefix is shared. Mixing pointers, arrays, function pointers, and scalars in one declaration makes
review and later edits prone to type mistakes.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-141`][c-code-standard-cstyle-141]

**CWE:** [CWE-704][cwe-704]

A pointer hidden behind `typedef` changes the meaning of qualifiers in ways that are easy to
misread. `const handle_t` may make the pointer itself const rather than the pointed object. Keep
ordinary indirection visible.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-156`][c-code-standard-cstyle-156]

**CWE:** [CWE-704][cwe-704], [CWE-758][cwe-758]

A byte buffer may have enough bytes for an object while still lacking the required alignment,
effective-type/lifetime conditions, or valid pointer provenance for typed access. This appears

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-153`][c-code-standard-cstyle-153]

**CWE:** [CWE-825][cwe-825], [CWE-562][cwe-562]

A block-scope compound literal has automatic storage duration for its enclosing block. If a callee

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-248`][c-code-standard-cstyle-248]

**CWE:** [CWE-758][cwe-758]

The program produces the expected result only because the current compiler, ABI, or architecture

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-264`][c-code-standard-cstyle-264]

**CWE:** [CWE-20][cwe-20], [CWE-682][cwe-682]

NaN and infinity can bypass ordinary range reasoning: comparisons with NaN do not behave like
comparisons with a very large or very small finite number. Sensor, network, or file inputs that feed
finite physical limits need an explicit exceptional- value check.

**Primary prevention rule:** [`CSTYLE-259`][c-code-standard-cstyle-259]

**CWE:** [CWE-362][cwe-362], [CWE-667][cwe-667]

A lockless algorithm assumes a source read/store occurs once, but the compiler merges, splits,
reloads, eliminates, or invents accesses under ordinary C rules. The protocol needs an approved

Direct register dereferences scattered across modules bypass the one place that knows width,

**CWE:** [CWE-1332][cwe-1332] **CAPEC:** [CAPEC-624][capec-624]

A security decision such as verified/not-verified or locked/unlocked is represented by a single

## Appendix A. Complete host regression program

This test translation unit links the complete sources in the two normative documents. Its ten named
test groups cover checked size arithmetic, bounded numeric parsing, wire encoding/decoding,
allocation failure, failure atomicity, zero/capacity boundaries, callback failure, reentry
rejection, invalid contract arguments, and composed ownership. The test allocator counts its bounded
fixture allocations and can reject the next allocation without freeing the old one.

`test_require` has a documented host-test fatal policy. A failed test stops the process even in
release builds; it is not compiled out by NDEBUG. Negative tests exercise documented rejection
paths, including BUSY during a synchronous callback. They are not examples of permitted production
reentry. No test passes a dangling pointer, performs invalid free, or depends on undefined behavior
to count as a pass.

The suite does not claim to exercise every CPIT. Thread races, GC relocation, real-time behavior,
hardware protocols, cryptography, web services, and runtime plugin loading need separate
implementations and target-specific evidence.

## Appendix B. Research and link record

The source records below distinguish language and tool documentation from publication metadata. Each
access record states the scope and date of the recorded review. A live landing page does not mean
the full licensed standard was reviewed. Tools may show a redirected publisher URL; canonical
destinations are used below. Sources can change after this recorded check.

Project requirements remain project decisions unless an explicit source and relevant scope support a
stronger attribution. Use the source records to check the basis and limits of a claim, alongside the
implementation and verification evidence for the target under review.

Some source endpoints could not be retrieved: individual CERT wiki pages, the MISRA site, the CISA
catalogue, POSIX web pages, and the OWASP Top 10 landing page. They are not labeled verified here.
The verified SEI publication page and specific OWASP cheat sheets replace inaccessible broad links.
No claims of full MISRA, CERT, ISO/IEC TS 17961, ISO/IEC 24772, or domain-standard compliance are
made. Those standards remain relevant to an owner's separately licensed and scoped conformance
assessment; this set does not invent clause mappings.

### Specific corrections and evidence limits

The allocation correction uses the C23 draft's allocation clauses. The draft also describes object
void-pointer conversions; it does not impose this project's required explicit casts or typed NULL.
Project conventions also require function-entry declarations and single-exit control flow. The
initializers and failure scenarios are project implementations, not quotations from that draft. The
final ISO edition is identified by its catalogue entry, not represented by the draft as though they
were the same document.

CMake and binutils documentation supply tool behavior for artifact and export checks. The example is
compiled with the installed tool versions recorded in the validation report, not whatever version a
moving `latest` manual may describe. OWASP sources provide the application-boundary context for
retained controls; no web-service or cryptographic implementation was tested by this delivery.

The anti-slop core, copywriting, and code-comment guidance were read from the requested repository.
Their editorial role is separate from language semantics. The core file's observed Git blob SHA was
`859fdc8138a71e7fbeb4bf4fcd2f90043eeb7648`; the code-comment skill's blob SHA was
`dddad435091bd02310c9d800e5ee6a372fcf58e8`. No third-party installer ran, and no persistent user
configuration was modified.

## Appendix C. Maintained optimization regression test

This test supplies executable evidence for the reference/candidate example, not for each contextual
snippet in the catalogue or for microarchitectural speed. It executes 32 offsets, 129 lengths and 5
search bytes, plus explicit invalid- pointer checks. The four-byte candidate includes a scalar tail.
